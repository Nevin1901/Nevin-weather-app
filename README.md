# Nevin-weather-app

A website which will tell you the weather in your area, show you a map of the weather around your area, and show a cool unsplash image as the background which (hopefully) relates to the current weather forecast

This is probably my first actual project which I uploaded to github

# Running it

```
npm i
node index.js
```

Then go to `localhost:3000` and it should be working. Also, since this uses your location to get the weather, some privacy respective browsers might block it (like waterfox), so I reccomend that you either use firefox or chrome

# TODO

Everything on this list has been done. If you have any future suggestions, please let me know
