# Nevin-weather-app

Made by:

Weather app made by Victor and Nevin in a few days using the openweather api. Not complete yet

This is probably my first actual project which I uploaded to github

# TODO

Make different gifs for each of the different descriptions
Make everything async so I can keep on refreshing the weather every couple of seconds until it loads

Recode the entire thing because right now its kind of slow and not too greatly coded

Also move this to herokuapp and change it to http in a seperate branch. I don't care if this specific project isn't https because I am already loading an iframe
