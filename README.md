Weather app made by Victor and Nevin in a few days using the openweather api. Not complete yet

This is probably my first actual project which I uploaded to github

# TODO

Make different gifs for each of the different descriptions
Make everything async so I can keep on refreshing the weather every couple of seconds until it loads

Recode the entire thing because right now its kind of slow and not too greatly coded
